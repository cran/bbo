Description: This package provides an R implementation of
        Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), originally invented by
        Prof. Dan Simon, Cleveland State University, Ohio. This method
        is an application of the concept of biogeography, a study of
        the geographical distribution of biological organisms, to
        optimization problems. More information about this method can
        be found here: http://academic.csuohio.edu/simond/bbo/.
